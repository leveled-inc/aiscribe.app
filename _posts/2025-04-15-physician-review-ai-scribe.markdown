The promise of an AI scribe is intoxicating: an end to "pajama time," more face-to-face interaction with patients, and a significant reduction in the daily grind of documentation. As a primary care physician drowning in administrative work, I was intrigued but skeptical. Could it really work? I decided to take the plunge. Our practice ran a pilot program with a popular ambient AI scribe, and I volunteered.

Here's an honest account of my first 30 days—the good, the challenging, and the ultimately transformative.

### Week 1: Skepticism and Awkwardness

The first few days were strange. Knowing a microphone was capturing everything felt unnatural, for both me and my patients. I followed the script, introducing the device as "a secure AI assistant to help with notes so I can give you my full attention." Most patients were surprisingly unfazed, often replying with "Oh, that's neat." A few older patients were a bit wary, but accepted it after I reassured them about privacy.

The biggest hurdle was my own behavior. I was so used to typing during visits that I initially felt like I had forgotten how to have a conversation. I also found myself "performing" for the AI, speaking in unnaturally clear, structured sentences. The first batch of notes I reviewed were okay, but they felt stilted, reflecting my own awkwardness. The AI correctly captured what I said, but because *I* was being unnatural, the notes were too.

**Time Saved: Minimal.** The time I saved on typing was spent anxiously reviewing notes, correcting my own stilted language, and getting used to the new workflow.

### Week 2: Finding a Groove

By the second week, something started to click. I began to trust that the AI was doing its job, which allowed me to relax. I stopped "performing" and started having normal, free-flowing conversations with my patients. The result was immediate and profound.

The AI notes started coming back not just accurate, but coherent and well-organized. It was like watching a master scribe at work, pulling the relevant clinical details out of our conversation and weaving them into a perfect SOAP note. I was spending less time correcting the AI and more time marveling at its ability to summarize a complex discussion.

This was also when I truly felt the benefit of being screen-free. I was making more eye contact. I was picking up on non-verbal cues I would have missed before. I had a patient break down in tears discussing a family issue—a moment I honestly believe I would have missed had I been staring at my laptop.

**Time Saved: ~45-60 minutes per day.**

### Week 3: The "Wow" Moment

The "wow" moment came on a Tuesday afternoon. I saw my last patient at 4:30 PM. I spent about 15 minutes reviewing and signing off on the AI-generated notes from my last few encounters. And then... I was done.

I packed my bag and walked out of the office at 4:45 PM. There was no mountain of charts to finish, no "pajama time" looming over me. The feeling was surreal. For the first time in years, my workday ended when my patient care ended. I went home and had dinner with my family, and I wasn't mentally exhausted or distracted by a lingering to-do list. This was the moment I became a true believer.

**Time Saved: ~90-120 minutes per day.**

### Week 4: A New Normal

By the end of the first month, the AI scribe had become an indispensable part of my workflow. It felt as natural as my stethoscope. The technology had faded into the background, and the benefits were clear. My notes were more detailed and accurate than ever, yet I was spending a fraction of the time on them. My patient interactions felt more human and connected.

Of course, it's not perfect. It occasionally mishears a word or gets a name wrong. I still have to do a final review and sign every note. But these are minor quibbles. The AI handles 95% of the work, and I've become an efficient editor.

### Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. Without a doubt. The AI scribe has done more to combat my personal feelings of burnout than any other initiative or tool I've experienced in my career. It has given me back hours in my day, but more importantly, it has allowed me to be the kind of attentive, present physician I've always wanted to be. The skepticism is gone, replaced by a sense of relief and a renewed passion for my work. If you're on the fence, I have just one piece of advice: try it.
