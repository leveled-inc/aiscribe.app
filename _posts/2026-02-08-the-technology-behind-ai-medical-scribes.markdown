AI medical scribes seem almost magical in their ability to transform a natural conversation into a structured clinical note. But what is the technology that powers these intelligent assistants? This post takes a look under the hood at the technology behind AI medical scribes.

At the heart of every AI medical scribe is a technology called automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR is the same technology that powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. It works by converting spoken language into text. However, the ASR used in AI medical scribes is specially trained on medical terminology to ensure that it can accurately transcribe the complex language of medicine.

Once the conversation has been transcribed, the next step is to extract the clinically relevant information. This is done using a technology called natural language processing (NLP). NLP algorithms are able to identify key concepts in the text, such as symptoms, diagnoses, medications, and procedures. They can also understand the relationships between these concepts, such as which medication is being used to treat which diagnosis.

After the clinically relevant information has been extracted, it is then used to generate a structured clinical note. This is done using a technology called natural language generation (NLG). NLG algorithms are able to take the structured data from the NLP step and convert it into a human-readable narrative. The resulting note is then formatted to meet the specific requirements of the EHR.

The combination of these three technologies—ASR, NLP, and NLG—is what makes AI medical scribes so powerful. By leveraging these technologies, AI scribes are able to automate the entire clinical documentation process, from conversation to note.

As the technology continues to advance, we can expect to see AI medical scribes become even more accurate, efficient, and intelligent. The future of clinical documentation is here, and it is powered by AI.
