Medical Scribe is an AI-powered clinical documentation solution that listens to patient-physician conversations and automatically generates accurate, structured clinical notes.

## Our Mission

We believe physicians should spend their time caring for patients, not typing into computers. Medical Scribe uses advanced ambient AI technology to eliminate the documentation burden that drives burnout and takes clinicians away from what matters most.

## How It Works

1. **Natural Conversation** - Speak naturally with your patients while Medical Scribe listens
2. **Intelligent Processing** - Our AI understands medical context, terminology, and clinical intent
3. **Structured Notes** - Review and approve comprehensive notes in your preferred format
4. **EHR Integration** - Notes flow directly into your electronic health record

## Built for Clinicians

Medical Scribe was designed in partnership with physicians across specialties. We understand the unique documentation needs of primary care, specialty medicine, and hospital settings.
